# Predict Diabetes (Test Project)

The system is designed to be a screening tool and should be used in conjunction with professional medical advice

Diabetes Prediction System - Core Logic Explained

1. Data Collection
   The system collects 11 key health parameters from patients:
   Age
   Gender
   Height
   Weight
   BMI (Body Mass Index)
   Blood Pressure (High and Low)
   Random Blood Sugar (RBS)
   Fasting Blood Sugar (FBS)
   Waist measurement
   Hip measurement
2. Prediction Process
   The system uses a machine learning model to predict HbA1c levels, which is a key indicator for diabetes. Here's how it works:
   Step 1: Data Preparation
   The system takes patient data and normalizes it to ensure consistent analysis
   It checks for any missing or invalid values
   The data is converted into a format suitable for the prediction model
   Step 2: Prediction
   The model predicts the HbA1c value, which is then categorized into three levels:
   Non-Diabetic: HbA1c < 5.7%
   Pre-Diabetic: HbA1c between 5.7% and 6.5%
   Diabetic: HbA1c ≥ 6.5%
   Step 3: Risk Assessment
   Based on the HbA1c prediction, the system assigns a risk level:
   Low Risk: For non-diabetic patients
   Moderate Risk: For pre-diabetic patients
   High Risk: For diabetic patients
3. Results Interpretation
   The system provides:
   The predicted HbA1c value
   The patient's diabetic status
   Risk level assessment
   A clear description of what the results mean
   Information about how far the patient is from the next threshold (e.g., how close a pre-diabetic patient is to becoming diabetic)
4. Medical Guidelines
   The system follows standard medical guidelines for diabetes diagnosis:
   Non-Diabetic: HbA1c < 5.7%
   Pre-Diabetic: HbA1c 5.7% - 6.4%
   Diabetic: HbA1c ≥ 6.5%
